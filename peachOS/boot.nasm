;##### times 510-($ - $$) db 0 #######

;times 510-($ - $$) db 0
;times directive:

;The times directive is used to repeat a certain instruction or data a specific number of times. It's typically used to fill memory with a value or pad data to a specific size.
;510 - ($ - $$):

;510 refers to the size in bytes of the boot sector minus the last 2 bytes (which are reserved for the boot signature).
;$ is a special symbol in assembly that represents the current address (the address of the next instruction or data).
;$$ is a special symbol representing the beginning of the section (or in this case, the beginning of the boot sector).
;($ - $$) calculates the number of bytes from the start of the section (boot sector) to the current position $. This gives the number of bytes already written to the boot sector.
;So, 510 - ($ - $$) calculates how many bytes remain to reach the 510th byte of the boot sector.
;db 0:

;db stands for "define byte", and it inserts a byte of data.
;db 0 inserts a byte with the value 0 (i.e., a null byte).

;##### dw 0xAA55 #######


;The line dw 0xAA55 is placing the boot signature at the end of the boot sector. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

;dw 0xAA55
;dw directive:

;dw stands for "define word." In x86 assembly, a "word" is typically 2 bytes (16 bits).
;This directive stores a 16-bit (2-byte) value at the current memory location.
;0xAA55:

;This is the value being stored, written in hexadecimal (base 16).
;It is a magic number that serves as the boot signature. The specific value 0xAA55 is used by the BIOS to identify a valid boot sector.
;0xAA is the high byte, and 0x55 is the low byte when stored in little-endian format (which is typical on x86 systems).
